These hooks are used to verify that location of code snippets sourced by Asciidoc in different repositories are
have not moved during commit.

This ensures that documentation stays accurate. Users is responsible to update documentation if he wants to push such commit upstream.

== Source Snippet activation 

Git hooks are looking for position of following markers in modified files:

* +@asciidoc-snippet-start+
* +@asciidoc-snippet-end+

In your code, annotate snippets to be used source in documentation by annotation:

[source,java]
----
// @asciidoc-snippet-start
public void myDocumentedMethod() {
    // do some awesome stuff here
}
// @asciidoc-snippet-end
----

[source,xml]
----
<my-xml-doc>
    <!-- @asciidoc-snippet-start -->
    <my-documented-configuration>
        <do-staff awesome="true" />
    </my-documented-configuration>
    <!-- @asciidoc-snippet-end -->
</my-xml-doc>
----
